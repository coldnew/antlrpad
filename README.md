# AntlrPad

Similar to JSFiddle, CodePen and other online playgrounds for all kinds of languages AntlrPad provides a way to quickly
test your Antlr4 grammars, parse expressions and build parse trees, see errors and warnings and analyse grammar performance.

# Roadmap
- [x] Share parsing result (via link)
- [ ] Return and highlight errors (both grammar and parsed tree)
- [ ] Grammar file syntax highlight
- [ ] Add separate lexical grammar support
- [ ] Add set of "test" grammars (C#, Java, Python)
- [ ] UI (Angular?)
